# Location Inference UI

Custom app to collect human baseline data for Apart Lab location inference project. We will use [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/) for crowdsourcing.

## Bugs to Fix

(as of 2024-10-16)

- Race conditions; getting the same image again
- Reloading...?
- Add agreement
- Improve log in page UI

- Allow for users to variable amount of images? if we are not crowdsourcing
