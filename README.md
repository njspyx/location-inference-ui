# Location Inference UI

Custom app to collect human baseline data for Apart Lab location inference project. We will use [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/) for crowdsourcing.

## TODO

- Fix one-hot encoding criteria for now. Don't allow user to continue if no criteria is selected.
- Time user guesses and save.
- Add CSS to make things look better.
- Connect Firebase (or something else) for the backend.
- Host the app via netlify or smth
- Allow user give explainations (in a better way?) somehow and figure out how to save/validate this information.
